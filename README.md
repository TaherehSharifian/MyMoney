## more about MyMoney 
You will be able to sign up and make a personal account in this project to track your transactions.
The list of transactions will be empty at users first **login** (after **signing up**) and after adding new transactions, they will be available at every visit. Users can **logout** as well and login later.

Users can **add** new transactions with a little form design at the right side of the page. Every transaction can be **deleted** after it's added to the list.

Multiple routes are built in **MyMoney** as follows:

 - `/` which in home route, where all transactions are available
 - `/login` which users can login
 - `/signup` which users can signup
